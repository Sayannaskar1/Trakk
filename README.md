Trakk is a real-time location tracking web application built using Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, and Leaflet.js.
It allows users to view the live geographical location of connected devices on an interactive map in real time. 
Each userâ€™s location is marked on the map, and the view updates instantly as users move. 
When a user disconnects, their marker is automatically removed from the map.
This project demonstrates real-time communication, geolocation tracking, and map visualization using modern web technologies.
